# Enhanced-Subset-KronoDriod

**This repository contains dataset files and code files.**


The three dataset files are:

a. kronodroid-combined-2008-to-2020.zip: this is an enhanced balanced subset of the datasets https://github.com/aleguma/kronodroid/tree/main/real_device and https://github.com/semw/kronodroid_improved_hybrid_detection_v2. It is used in RO-1.

b. Kronodroid-combined-2008-2018.zip: this contains samples from 2008-2018 only. It is used as training set in RO-2.

c. Test-set-2019.csv: this contains samples from 2019 only. It is used as test set 1 in RO-2.

d. Test-set-2020.csv: this contains samples from 2020 only. It is used as test set 2 in RO-2.



The twelve code files are named according to the research objective, model used, and setup (CPU and GPU):

a. RO-1-LR-CPU.py

b. RO-1-LR-GPU.py

c. RO-1-SGD-CPU.py

d. RO-1-SGD-GPU.py

e. RO-1-RF-CPU.py

f. RO-1-RF-GPU.py

g. RO-1-NN-CPU.py

h. RO-1-NN-GPU.py

i. RO-2-LR.py

j. RO-2-SGD.py

k. RO-2-RF.py

l. RO-2-NN.py


There is one EXCEL file that lists the static and dynamic features selected by each model as shown in Table 6 of the paper.
